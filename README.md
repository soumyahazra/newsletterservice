# Newsletter Subscription Service

A Restful API which allows users to perform various subscription services. It uses H2 as the in-memory DB. Hence the tests are portable for this application.

## Technology stack

Spring Boot (2.1.8) and Spring MVC have been used to develop and expose the Rest endpoints. H2 is used as the DB (in-memory).

## Requirements

1. Java - 1.8.x

2. Maven - 3.x.x

## Steps to Setup

**1. Clone the application**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soumyahazra/newsletterservice.git
```

**2. Build and run the app**

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The app will start running at <http://localhost:8080>
